CV, a LaTeX package for typesetting a curriculum vitae.

Copyright (C) 2001  Philipp Maier (pmaier@yahoo.com)

The package consists of three files:

CV.sty      		LaTeX package
CVCTAN.tex  		Example curriculum vitae
ApplicationLetter 	Example application letter

I have decided to include an example application letter as several people 
requested it. It is based on application letters I wrote, so it uses a 
German class. Unfortunately, it might require some experimenting for 
English speaking TeX-Users to obtain the required results...

This is the first style I have written, and I am neither a LaTeX expert, 
nor a programmer, so please don't be too harsh on me... :-)
