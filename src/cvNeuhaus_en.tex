\section{Thesis}
\noindent A special feature of the German financial system is the position of
the \emph{Deutsche Bundesbank}, which is considered to be one of the
most independent central banks in the world. The purpose of this
research is to analyse to which extent this formal independent
position has led to less political influence on the central
bank than, for instance, in the USA.

  \emph{Overview:} The construction of new motorways is often
  considered as a means to foster economic growth in less developed
  regions. This research project aimed at investigating the economic
  effects of newly build motorways in Germany. My main tasks were to
  provide an overview over the literature and to develop the basic
  structure of a model which was later used to to quantify the
  economic effects.
